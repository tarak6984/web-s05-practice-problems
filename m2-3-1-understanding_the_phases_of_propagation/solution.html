    Add a listener for event of type "click" to the elements right above. The first two are done for you.
    Also add a click event listener to the `document` object.
    Open the Console and click on the button. Do you see the click event bubbling up the DOM?

    PROBLEM 2:
    Add a click event listener to the global `window` object, but set it to fire on capture, instead of on bubbling.
