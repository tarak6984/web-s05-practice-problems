  <h1>Using Functions That Return Promises SOLUTION</h1>
  <p>These problems don't require that you write any code. For each problem you must guess what the output to the
    console will be.</p>
  <script>
    /*
    PROBLEM 1:
    The greetAsynchronously function takes a name and returns a promise that fulfills a value in the future.
    Which of the following console.logs will print true? Why? Think about it before checking the console.
    */
    function greetAsynchronously(name) {
      return Promise.resolve(`Hello, ${name}!`) // don't worry about how this line works
    }
    const value = greetAsynchronously('Peter')
    console.log('PROBLEM 1. Is value a string? -->', value instanceof String)
    console.log('PROBLEM 1. Is value a promise? -->', value instanceof Promise)
    /*
    SOLUTION: greetAsynchronously returns a promise that represents the future value. Because a promise is an object with methods, this means it cannot be a string. So the first log statement should turn out false and the second one true.
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 2:
    One of the functions below takes two numbers and returns their sum. The other one returns a promise that fulfills the sum in the future.
    Which result will print to the console first, 7 or 12? Why? Think about it before checking the console.
    */
    function sumAsynchronously(a, b) {
      return Promise.resolve(a + b) // don't worry about how this line works
    }
    function sumSynchronously(a, b) {
      return a + b
    }
    console.log('PROBLEM 2:')
    sumAsynchronously(3, 4).then(console.log) // the result will be 7
    console.log(sumSynchronously(5, 7)) // the result will be 12
    /*
    SOLUTION: sumAsynchronously has its result handled (in this case printed) asynchronously, in a future when all pending synchronous work is done.
    This means that we will first see number 12 printed in the console (sync work), and then 7 (future, async work).
