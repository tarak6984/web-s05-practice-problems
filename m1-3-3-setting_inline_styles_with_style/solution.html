    /*
    PROBLEM 1: Add an inline style to the appropriate element to make all the content of the body to Verdana, or Geneva if Verdana is unavailabe, Tahoma if Verdana and Geneva aren't available, and finally sans-serif if the first three choices are not available.

    */
    //See line 4, the body tag

    /*
    PROBLEM 2: Add the appropriate inline style to the appropriate element that will center the heading one  text and make it blue.
    */
    //See line 5, the h1 tag

     /*
    PROBLEM 3: Add the appropriate inline style to the first paragraph element to have the left margin to 100px and the right margin to 90px.
    */
    //See line 6, the p tag
    /*
    PROBLEM 4: Modify the section element's inline style to include a  50px margin all around and a background color or dimgray. Modify the last heading element to have inline style color red, background color of white, margin of 35px and text align is center.
    */
    //See line 34, the section tag and line 39, the h4 tag

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): How could you test the effect of you font choices you made in the body element? What could you do to see the page in Geneva or Tahoma or sans-serif?

    To test the fonts, remove the last letter in Verdana to make it Verdan, a non existent font. Geneva should then be used as the font. Once this is proven, remove the last letter in Geneva to make Gevev, another non existing font that will have browser use Tahoma. Repeat for Tahoma to see san-serif as the display. Fix the font names one at a time starting with Tahoma and working backwards to ensure that it's working as intended
