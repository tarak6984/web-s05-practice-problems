  <h1>Handling Success With Then SOLUTION</h1>
  <p>All your solutions for this set of practice problems will print in the console.</p>

    /*
    PROBLEM 1:
    The function greetAsync below takes a name (E.G. "Anne") and returns a promise which fulfills a greeting (E.G. "Hello, Anne!").
    Invoke the function and handle success with `.then` by console logging the fulfilled value three times.
    */
    function greetAsync(name) {
      // Do not worry about how this function works internally
      return Promise.resolve(`Hello, ${name}!`)

    greetAsync('Garfield').then(greet => {
      console.log(greet)
      console.log(greet)
      console.log(greet)
    })
    /*
    PROBLEM 2:
    The function coinTossAsync below returns a promise which fulfills a random Boolean (either `true` or `false`).
    Invoke the function and handle success by console logging "It's heads!" if the Boolean is `true` and "It's tails!" otherwise.
    */
    function coinTossAsync() {
      // Do not worry about how this function works internally
      return Promise.resolve(!!Math.floor(Math.random() * 2))

    // ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
    coinTossAsync().then(bool => {
      console.log(`It's ${bool ? 'heads' : 'tails'}!`)
    })
    /*
   PROBLEM 3:
    The function getYearAsync below returns a promise that fulfills the current year as a string (E.G. 2023).
    Invoke the function and handle success by console logging "The year is <year>!" (E.G. "The year is 2023.").
    Also inside the success handler, calculate your age by substracting your year of birth from the current year, and log it out.
   */
    function getYearAsync() {
      // Do not worry about how this function works internally
      return Promise.resolve(new Date().getFullYear())
    }
    // ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
    getYearAsync().then(year => {
      console.log(`The year is ${year}.`)
      console.log(`I am ${year - 1977} years old.`)
