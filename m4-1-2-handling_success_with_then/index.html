    PROBLEM 1:
    The function greetAsync below takes a name (E.G. "Anne") and returns a promise which fulfills a greeting (E.G. "Hello, Anne!").
    Invoke the function and handle success with `.then` by console logging the fulfilled value three times.

    PROBLEM 2:
    The function coinTossAsync below returns a promise which fulfills a random Boolean (either `true` or `false`).
    Invoke the function and handle success by console logging "It's heads!" if the Boolean is `true` and "It's tails!" otherwise.

   PROBLEM 3:
    The function getYearAsync below returns a promise that fulfills the current year (E.G. 2023).
    Invoke the function and handle success by console logging "The year is <year>!" (E.G. "The year is 2023.").
    Also inside the success handler, calculate your age by substracting your year of birth from the current year, and log it out.
