    /*
    PROBLEM 1:
    In the following code, we are selecting all the elements above this script tag, and adding a click event listener to each.
    👉 Inside the event listener, study the event object with a console log. Find the `currentTarget` property of the event object.
    👉 Extract the `className` and the `nodeName` properties from the `currentTarget` and store them into variables.
    👉 Create a log statement that will print something like "The <className> element is a <nodeName>", using your variables to construct the string.
    👉 Click the button, and observe in the console the firing of the listeners, as the event bubbles up the DOM!
    👉 Note how the listener attached to the target fires first.
    */
    let elements = Array.from(document.getElementsByTagName('*'))
    elements.forEach(element => {
      element.addEventListener('click', event => {
        // PROBLEM 1
        const { className, nodeName } = event.currentTarget
        console.log(`The ${className} element is a ${nodeName}`)
        if (event.currentTarget === document.querySelector('section')) { // PROBLEM 3
          console.log('\tI love this section!')
        }
      }, { capture: true }) // PROBLEM 2
    })

    /*
    PROBLEM 2:
    It's possible to set up a click listener so that it executes as the event dives towards the target of the event.
    👉 Note that in `addEventListener` above, the first argument is the string 'click' and the second argument is a function.
    👉 Add a third argument which is an object like so: { capture: true }. This object allows to pass options into `addEventListener`
    👉 Click the button, and observe in the console how the order of execution of the listeners reverses itself, with the target firing last.
    */

    /*
    PROBLEM 3:
    Sometimes you need to know if the event is currently firing on one element or another, to take different actions.
    👉 Inside the click event listener above add code so that if the current target is equal to the section element, console log "I love this section!".
    👉 In order to compare event.currentTarget to the section, you'll need to grab the section element using querySelector.
